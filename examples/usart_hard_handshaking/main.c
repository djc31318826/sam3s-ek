/**
 *  \page usart_hard_handshaking USART Hardware Handshaking Example
 *
 *  \section Purpose
 *
 *  This example demonstrates the hardware handshaking mode (i.e. RTS/CTS)
 *  provided by the USART peripherals on SAM3S microcontrollers. The practical
 *  use of hardware handshaking is that it allows to stop transfer on the USART
 *  without losing any data in the process. This is very useful for applications
 *  that need to program slow memories for example.
 *
 *  \section Requirements
 *
 *  This example can be used on sam3s-ek. It requires a serial line with
 *  hardware control support( TXD and RXD cross over, RTS and CTS cross over)
 *  to connect the board and pc.
 *
 *  \section Description
 *
 *  The provided program uses hardware handshaking mode to regulate the data
 *  rate of an incoming file transfer. A terminal application, such as
 *  hyperterminal, is used to send a text file to the device (without any
 *  protocol such as X-modem). The device will enforce the configured
 *  bytes per second (bps) rate with its Request To Send (RTS) line.
 *
 *  Whenever the data rate meet or exceed the configurable threshold, the device
 *  stops receiving data on the USART. Since no buffer is provided to the PDC,
 *  this will set the RTS line, telling the computer to stop sending data. Each
 *  second, the current data rate and total number of bytes received are
 *  displayed; the transfer is also restarted.
 *
 *  Note that the device may receive slightly less bytes than the actual file
 *  size, depending on the nature of the file. This does NOT mean that bytes
 *  have been lost: this is simply an issue with how line breaks are transmitted
 *  by the terminal. It is therefore better to use binary files, as they most
 *  often do not contain line breaks. For example, send one of the object files
 *  generated by the compiler.
 *
 *  \section Usage
 *
 *  -# Build the program and download it inside the evaluation board. Please
 *     refer to the <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc6224.pdf">SAM-BA User Guide</a>,
 *     the <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc6310.pdf">GNU-Based Software Development</a>
 *     application note or to the <a href="ftp://ftp.iar.se/WWWfiles/arm/Guides/EWARM_UserGuide.ENU.pdf">IAR EWARM User Guide</a>,
 *     depending on your chosen solution.
 *  -# Connect a serial cable to the USART0 port on the evaluation kit. It will
 *     most often be labeled "RS232 COM port".
 *  -# On the computer, open and configure a terminal application (e.g.
 *     HyperTerminal on Microsoft Windows) with these settings:
 *        - 115200 bauds
 *        - 8 data bits
 *        - No parity
 *        - 1 stop bit
 *        - Hardware flow control (RTS/CTS)
 *  -# Start the application. The following traces shall appear on the terminal:
 *     \code
 *     -- USART Hardware Handshaking Example xxx --
 *     -- xxxxxx-xx
 *     -- Compiled: xxx xx xxxx xx:xx:xx --
 *     Bps:    0; Tot:      0
 *     \endcode
 *  -# Send a file in text format to the device. On HyperTerminal, this is done
 *     by selecting "Transfer -> Send Text File" (this does not prevent you from
 *     sending binary files). The transfer will start and the device will update
 *     the bps and total counts on the terminal.
 *  -# Whenever the transfer is complete, the total number of bytes received
 *     should match the size of the sent file (unless it is a text file, see
 *     explanation in description section).
